# Output
# 1. Foundational Concepts of Generative AI
Generative Artificial Intelligence (Generative AI) refers to a subset of AI techniques that enable machines to create new content—such as text, images, audio, video, or code—based on patterns learned from existing data. Unlike traditional AI models that only perform classification or regression (predicting labels or values), Generative AI models can produce original outputs that resemble real-world data.

Core Principles:

Data Learning: Generative models learn the underlying probability distribution of training data.

Generative vs. Discriminative Models:

Discriminative models focus on distinguishing between different classes (e.g., spam vs. not spam).

Generative models focus on generating new data points from the same distribution as the training data.

Training Process: These models are typically trained using large datasets and optimization algorithms (e.g., gradient descent).

Probabilistic Modeling: They use mathematical models to estimate the likelihood of certain data configurations and generate new variations.

Self-supervised Learning: Many modern generative AI models use self-supervised approaches, learning from raw, unlabeled data by predicting missing parts.

Examples:

Large Language Models (LLMs) such as GPT-4, Gemini, and LLaMA.

Image generation models like DALL·E, Midjourney, and Stable Diffusion.

Music generation models like Jukebox.
